# Data-Driven Optimization of Building Layouts for Energy Efficiency

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to optimize building layouts for improved energy efficiency. The goal is to develop a data-driven solution that minimizes energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. By utilizing a dataset that includes hourly energy consumption, building metadata, and weather conditions, this project aims to model and predict energy usage, identify inefficiencies, and propose actionable layout optimizations.

## Project Objectives

- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Use machine learning models to understand how building layout, usage patterns, and environmental factors influence energy consumption.
- **Energy Consumption Optimization**: Propose optimizations for building layouts to reduce energy consumption without compromising occupant comfort or functionality.
- **Scalable Solution**: Develop a methodology that can be applied to various types of buildings, both commercial and residential, to optimize energy efficiency at scale.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the relationships between building characteristics, environmental factors, and energy consumption through statistical analysis and data visualization.
- **Machine Learning Modeling**: Implement regression models to predict energy consumption based on building layouts, usage, and weather conditions.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Use optimization techniques to suggest changes to building layouts that can minimize energy consumption.
- **Cloud-based Computing**: Utilize Google Colab for training models on large datasets, making use of GPU acceleration for faster computations.
- **Data Visualization**: Provide detailed visualizations that highlight energy consumption trends and optimization opportunities.

## Data Sources

The dataset used for this project includes:
- **Energy Usage Data**: Hourly energy consumption data for multiple buildings.
- **Building Metadata**: Information such as building type, year built, floor count, and gross floor area.
- **Weather Data**: Meteorological data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and precipitation, which impact energy consumption.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Analysis: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`
  - Data Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Cloud Platform**: Google Colab for scalable machine learning model training and evaluation.
- **Version Control**: GitHub for project tracking and collaboration.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/energy-efficiency-optimization.git
   cd energy-efficiency-optimization
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the Google Colab notebook provided in the repository for running the data analysis and model training.

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load and clean the dataset, handle missing values, and create meaningful features from raw data.
2. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees) to predict energy consumption based on building layout and environmental conditions.
3. **Optimization**: Apply optimization algorithms to recommend changes in building layout that can reduce energy consumption.
4. **Evaluation**: Measure model performance using standard metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) and validate the recommendations with real-world data.

## Future Enhancements

- **Incorporating Real-Time Data**: Integrating real-time data from smart buildings to make dynamic optimization adjustments.
- **Additional Optimization Parameters**: Adding more constraints (e.g., cost of changes, occupant comfort levels) to make the optimization more practical.
- **Expanded Dataset**: Applying the model to a wider variety of building types and geographies for a more generalizable solution.
